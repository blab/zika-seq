# Two-step RT-PCR for amplicon generation

_Perform the following in a hood or in a pre-PCR designated area_

#### Reverse Transcription

1. For each sample, mix the following in a PCR tube (preferably individually-hinged strip tubes):

  * 7uL RNA
  * 1 uL random hexamers (50 ng/uL)

2. Mix by inversion then spin down.
3. Heat to 70 degrees Celsius for 7 minutes, then place on ice to prevent secondary structure from re-forming.
4. Add the following to each tube:

  * 10 uL ProtoScript II Reaction Mix
  * 2 uL ProtoScript II Enzyme Mix

5. Place on the thermocycler and run the following program:

  * 25 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes _**note: this step can be swapped for a 5 minute hold at room temperature_
  * 48 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes  
  * 80 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes
  * Hold at 10 degrees Celsius

#### Amplification PCR

6. Make the following mastermix in a 1.5 mL tube. You will need both a Pool 1 mastermix and a Pool 2 mastermix.

  * 8 uL Q5 Reaction Buffer
  * 0.8 uL 10 mM dNTPs
  * 0.4 uL Q5 DNA polymerase
  * 24.4 uL Nuclease-free water
  * 2.7 uL of primer pool (either pool 1 **OR** pool 2)

7. Label 2 0.2mL PCR tubes for each sample.
8. Pipette 36 uL of mastermix into the corresponding tubes.
9. Add 4 uL of cDNA into the corresponding tubes.
10. Mix by inversion and spin down.
11. Place on the thermocycler and run the following program:

  * Step 1: 98 degrees Celsius for 30 seconds (initial denaturation)
  * Step 2: _perform 45 cycles of_
    * 98 degrees Celsius for 15 seconds
    * 65 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes
  * Step 3: Hold at 4 degrees Celsius.
